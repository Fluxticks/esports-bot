<summary>Reaction Role Menus</summary>

### Reaction Role Menus
Esportsbot now includes a slightly stripped down version of the reaction menus implementation provided by [BASED](https://github.com/Trimatix/BASED).

Making new types of reaction menus is easy - simply extend `reactionMenus.reactionMenu.ReactionMenu`.

To register a menu instance for interaction, use `client.reactionMenus.add(yourMenuInstance)`. For an example of this, see `cogs.MenusCog.admin_cmd_make_role_menu`.

All saveable reaction menus are automatically added and removed from Esportsbot's PostgreSQL database, and will be loaded in again on bot startup. To register your `ReactionMenu` subclass as saveable, use the `reactionMenu.saveableMenu` class decorator. Saveable menus **MUST** provide complete `toDict` and `fromDict` implementations. For examples of this, see `reactionMenus.reactionRoleMenu`.

`ReactionMenu`s store each option in the menu as an instance of a `reactionMenu.ReactionMenuOption` subclass - each `ReactionMenuOption` has its own individual behaviour for when reactions are added and removed. This already provides a huge amount of flexibility, but you can achieve even more with a custom `ReactionMenuOption` subclass. To make your `ReactionMenuOption` saveable, provide complete `toDict` and `fromDict` implementations. For an example of this, see `reactionMenus.reactionRoleMenu.ReactionRoleMenuOption`.

##### !make-role-menu
```
!make-role-menu {title}
{option1 emoji} {@option1 role}
...    ...
```
Create a reaction role menu.

Each option must be on its own new line, as an emoji, followed by a space, followed by a mention of the role to grant.

The `title` is displayed at the top of the meny and is optional, to exclude your title simply give a new line.

##### !add-role-menu-option {menu-id} {emoji} {@role mention}
Add a role to a role menu.

To get the ID of a reaction menu, enable discord's developer mode, right click on the menu, and click Copy ID.

Your emoji must not be in the menu already, adding the same role more than once is allowed.

Give your role to grant/remove as a mention.

##### !del-role-menu-option {menu-id} {emoji}
Remove a role from a role menu.

To get the ID of a reaction menu, enable discord's developer mode, right click on the menu, and click Copy ID.

Your emoji must be an option in the menu.

##### !del-menu {id}
Remove the specified reaction menu. You can also just delete the message, if you have permissions.

To get the ID of a reaction menu, enable discord's developer mode, right click on the menu, and click Copy ID.
